# Key Concepts
### The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs

### Small Data examples
  Easy for humans to comprehend  
  Fitness Tracker recording Daily steps  
  Contacts in a mobile phones address book  
  A simp0le spreadsheet tracking monthly expenses  

  ### Big Data Examples
   extremely large and diverse collections of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that continues to grow exponentially over time. 
    These datasets are so huge and complex in volume, velocity, and variety, that traditional data management systems cannot store, process, and analyze them

### Types Of Data
  Qualitative  
    - Biominal -Like Binary 1/0 Yes/No  
    - Nominal - cannot be put into order. eg form of tranmsport bus,car,plane etc  
    - Ordial - Catagorical data that can be ordered eg agree, neutral, disagree  

  Qantitative  
    - Discrete - Non Divisable counts of something . eg no of customers in a store  
    - Continuous - Can take any VALUE bug and be made finer intyervals. example temperature, Length  

### Data Formats
   - Json -  
      Description:  
        JSON is a lightweight, human-readable format for transmitting data between servers and web applications,
        enhancing user experiences and performance. 
     Impact: 
       Many web applications, including social media platforms and e-commerce websites, rely on JSON for seamless communication.

  - CSV-  
    Description:   
      CSV is a widely used format for storing tabular data, facilitating efficient financial management and reporting processes. 
      A classic example is Microsoft Excel files.  
  
   Impact:   
      Financial institutions often use CSV files for data integration and analysis.  
  
  - XML -  
    Description:   
      XML is a markup language for structuring and exchanging data between systems, promoting interoperability.  
  
  Impact:   
    XML enables seamless communication and data exchange between disparate systems, fostering collaboration and enhancing the efficiency of information sharing in domains such as web services, e-commerce, healthcare, and finance.

  ### Cloud Computing Standards

  
The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a set of best practices and guidelines designed to help you build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient applications in the cloud. It focuses on six key areas, known as pillars:  
  
1. Operational Excellence: Ensuring your systems run smoothly and can be easily managed and improved.  
2. Security: Protecting your data and systems from threats.  
3. Reliability: Making sure your applications work correctly and can recover quickly from failures.  
4. Performance Efficiency: Using resources effectively to meet your needs.  
5. Cost Optimization: Managing costs to avoid unnecessary spending.  
6. Sustainability: Minimizing environmental impact by using resources efficiently  
  
OpenAPI is a specification for building and describing HTTP APIs in a way that is independent of any specific programming language.  

Standardized Format: OpenAPI provides a consistent way to define your API’s structure and behavior using a standard format, typically written in JSON or YAML.  
Language-Agnostic: It doesn’t matter what programming language your API is written in; OpenAPI can describe it.  
Documentation: It helps generate documentation automatically, making it easier for developers to understand and use your API.  
Tools Integration: You can use OpenAPI definitions with various tools to generate client libraries, server stubs, and even test cases.  
Lifecycle Support: OpenAPI supports the entire API lifecycle, from design and development to deployment and maintenance12.  
In essence, OpenAPI makes it easier to create, share, and maintain APIs by providing a clear and standardized way to describe them. Does that help clarify things?
