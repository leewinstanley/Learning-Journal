Revision Notes: Schemas and Integration (Rev. 1 - 2024)

Overview

This document summarizes key concepts and best practices related to schemas and database integration. It covers fundamental topics such as data profiling, indexing, query optimization, and security measures.

Topics Covered

1. Data Profiling

Definition: The process of analyzing data sources to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness.

Techniques:

Column profiling: Identifying patterns, missing values, and statistical distributions.

Cross-table analysis: Ensuring referential integrity across tables.

Redundancy detection: Spotting duplicate records and unnecessary attributes.

Tools: SQL queries, data profiling tools (e.g., Talend, Informatica, OpenRefine).

Explanation: Data profiling ensures that databases contain high-quality, reliable data by identifying anomalies and inconsistencies. This process is essential for data-driven decision-making.

Learn: Effective data profiling minimizes errors, improves data integration, and enhances analytical accuracy.

2. Primary Keys

Definition: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that no duplicate or NULL values exist in the key column(s).

Usage:

Used to uniquely identify records in a table.

Can be a single column or a composite key (multiple columns).

Best Practices:

Use an auto-incrementing integer or a universally unique identifier (UUID) for consistency.

Keep primary keys simple and immutable.

Avoid using business-sensitive data (e.g., email or social security numbers) as primary keys.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

Explanation: A primary key ensures data integrity by uniquely identifying each row. It prevents duplicate records and is essential for establishing relationships between tables.

Learn: Understanding primary keys helps in designing well-structured relational databases with proper integrity constraints.

3. Foreign Keys

Definition: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that establishes a relationship between the data in two tables.

Usage:

Ensures referential integrity by linking records between tables.

Prevents orphaned records (i.e., records with no corresponding parent record).

Best Practices:

Use indexes on foreign key columns for faster joins and lookups.

Define proper ON DELETE and ON UPDATE constraints to manage cascading actions.

Ensure data consistency by only allowing valid foreign key values.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

Explanation: A foreign key establishes a relationship between tables, enforcing consistency and maintaining data integrity.

Learn: Properly using foreign keys improves database normalization and prevents inconsistencies in relational databases.

6. Apache Iceberg

Definition: Apache Iceberg is an open-source table format designed for handling large-scale analytics datasets on distributed storage platforms like Hadoop, AWS S3, and Google Cloud Storage.

Features:

Schema Evolution: Supports adding, renaming, or dropping columns without breaking existing queries.

Hidden Partitioning: Eliminates the need for manual partition maintenance and improves query performance.

Time Travel: Enables querying historical versions of data using snapshots.

ACID Compliance: Ensures data consistency in multi-writer environments.

Example Usage:

CREATE TABLE iceberg_db.orders (
    order_id BIGINT,
    customer_id BIGINT,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    order_date TIMESTAMP
) USING iceberg;

Best Practices:

Use hidden partitioning to reduce query complexity.

Optimize performance with metadata pruning for efficient data scanning.

Implement snapshot expiration policies to manage storage costs.

Explanation: Apache Iceberg enhances data warehouse performance by enabling flexible schema management and efficient querying of large datasets.

Learn: Iceberg helps in modern data lake architectures by providing robust governance, transaction support, and scalable storage management.
